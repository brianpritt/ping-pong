#### By _Brian Pritt_

## Description

_Ping-Pong is a simple application that asks the user for a number, and then displays every number in the range of 1 to the inputted number.  It will then replace every number evenly divisible by 3 with ping, every number divisible by 5 with pong, and every number divisible by 15 with ping-pong._

### This application was designed using the following specifications:

##### _1. Test to see if input is a number._
* Input: p
* Output: "Please Enter a Number"

##### _2. Can application count to inputted number(no negative numbers)?_
* Input: 2
* Output: 1,2

##### _3. Replace all numbers in range that are divisible by 3 with "ping"_
* Input: 3
* Output: 1, 2, ping

##### _4. Replace all numbers in range that are divisible by 5 with "pong"_
* Input: 5
* Output: 1, 2, ping, 4, pong

##### _5. Replace all numbers in range that are divisible by 15 (that is, all numbers divisible by both 3 and 5) with "ping-pong"_
